In Lab 05 we worked with rangefinders. We used proximity sensors and ultrasonic rangefinders.

We first used the ultrasonic rangefinder to sense the distance of an object in the path of the sensor. Code for this is in 'Rangefinder.js'

Then we used the rangefinder to build a parking sensor. Two LEDs fade in and out according to the distance of the object from the sensor which can be mounted on a vehicle. The code is in 'fade_range.js'

Variations in experiment:
1. Used a proximity sensor instead of an ultrasonic one to measure range. The range of measurable distance was much smaller. But again, this is what the proximity sensor is commonly used for. In mobile phones and tablets.
The code is given in 'proximity.js', and is very similar to that for the ultrasonic one.

Others:
The fritzing diagram file is attached as 'sensor.fzz' and the Actual distance vs Measured distance table as 'Maxsonar sensor table.pdf'.

We could probably interface more sensors and displays to build something larger.
