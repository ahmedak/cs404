Lab 02 was about working with simple I/O devices like LEDs and buttons. LEDs were controlled from the beaglebone in the first part and via buttons in the second part of the lab.

In the first part, an external LED was setup to blink using blink_external.js present in this repository. The frequency was also varied to different values.

In the second part, two external LEDs were setup to be controlled by two external buttons. Code used for this experiment is in push_button.js.

Other variations of these experiments were also performed, such as 
1.	Pressing any button to light an LED, and  both to light both LEDs (contained in LED_var1.js)
2.	Pressing one button to blink an LED 10 times (contained in LED_var2.js)
3.	Pressing one switch to start an LED blinking, and pressing the other to stop it (contained in LED_var3.js)

Lab02 was fun and interesting, and we gained basic knowledge on how to operate basic I/O using the beaglebone. We also learnt some other things about our hardware, such as the breadboard whose power and ground rails were partitioned in half.
