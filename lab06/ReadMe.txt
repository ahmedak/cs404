  Lab 6 was an interesting exercise. We had got aJoystick and Led to work with.

  The first part of the lab was to get raw input values(both axes) from the joystick and also the button value and printing on the console.Code for this is in 'joy.js'.
  
  The second part was controlling the brightness of the Led with the joystick.The code for thi is in 'joy_brightness.js'.

Then we controlled a point on the Led matrix using the joystick in one dimension .The code for this is in 'joy_pointer.js'.

Then we used the joystick to move through a string "hi..k". Code for this is in 'joy_hi_K.js'.

The fritzing diagram is in the folder 'lab6.fzz'.
