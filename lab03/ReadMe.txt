Lab 03 was about working with analog I/O. LEDs were controlled from through PWMs on the beaglebone in the first part and via potientiometers in the second part of the lab.

In the first part, two external LEDs were setup to fade in and out using fade2.js present in this repository. The frequency was also varied to different values.

In the second part, analog values were read from a potentiometer(Analog_read.js), and displayed on the screen.

Other variations of these experiments were also performed, such as 
1.	Fading two LEDs in an alternating manner (contained in fade2_alt.js)
2.	Two external LEDs were setup to be controlled by a potentiometer. Code used for this experiment is in fade2_potentiometer.js.

Lab03 was kindof challenging, and we learnt to control analog I/O using the bone. Looking forward to using other analog I/O like joysticks and gyroscopes with the bone.
