Subject	: Project report on lab07

  In lab 07, we worked with Gyroscopes, accelerometers and thermometers.
  
  In the beginning values were read from the various sensors, and output to the console .The code used to interface to the sensor is in the file "gyro_acc_temp.js"
  
  Then values were read from the thermometer to a webpage "webpage_bone.html".The code for this function is the file "webpage_temp.js".

  Finally readings of both the thermometer and the accelerometer were given to the same webpage "webpage_bone.html" .The source code for this function is the file "webpage_all.js".
  
  Fritzing diagram for this lab is in lab7.fzz.
  
  
  Accelerometers and gyroscopes together can be used for tilt detection, damage detection, and for various other safety uses.
