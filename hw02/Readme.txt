#Updated to include changes in code.
This folder contains the following files:

etch-a-sketch-buttons.js
  This is a simple etch-a-sketch program written in JS. It takes input from 5 buttons up, left  , down, right, and clear.
  
push-button-4.js
  This is a javascript program that controls 4 leds via 4 buttons, all connected to the BeagleBone. Each led corresponding to a   button can be turned on/off seperately.

Prof. Yoder:
Good start.  The etch-a-sketch needs to be controlled by the buttons.
